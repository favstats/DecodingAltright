## What is the Alt-Right?

<!-- + Term coined by Richard Spencer -->

<!-- + Goals -->
<!--     * allowed ideas long seen as unacceptable to mainstream media to seep into public discourse (opening the Overton window) -->
<!--     * By re-branding “white nationalism” or “white supremacy” as “the alt-right,” these groups played on the media’s fascination with novelty to give their ideas mass exposure -->
<!--     * As Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin puts it, “Non-ironic Nazism masquerading as ironic Nazism.” -->

<!-- Why use it? The Nazis called themselves national socialists and we shouldn't call them socialists but they were a distinct phenomenon. They're also more diverse as we shall see -->

**Milo Yiannopolous' characterization of the Alt-Right:** $^1$

> *The alt-right is a movement born out of the youthful, subversive, **underground edges of the internet**. 4chan and 8chan are hubs of alt-right activity. For years, members of these forums – political and non-political – have delighted in **attention-grabbing, juvenile pranks**. Long before the alt-right, 4channers turned **trolling** the national media into an in-house sport.*

**Marwick and Lewis 2017**

> *Term coined by Richard Spencer to describe a version of **white nationalism** that positions itself as comprised of **younger, wealthier, and better-educated individuals** than traditional white supremacist groups like the Klu Klux Klan. Deeply entwined with social media and staples of **internet culture, like memes**. Believes that **“political correctness” threatens individual liberty**. Example: Jared Taylor of the American Renaissance, Mike Cernovich of Danger and Play.*

**Hawley 2017**

> *Using the loosest definition, we could say the Alt-Right includes anyone with right-wing sensibilities that **rejects the mainstream conservative movement**. But there are certain common, perhaps universal attitudes within the Alt-Right. The Alt-Right is **fundamentally concerned with race**. At its core, the Alt-Right is a white-nationalist movement, even if many (perhaps most) of the people who identify with the Alt-Right do not care for that term. The most energetic and significant figures of the movement want to see the creation of a **white ethnostate** in North America.*

**Non-ironic Nazism masquerading as ironic Nazism.**

## What is the Alt-Right?


A group of loosely aligned individuals and subgroups that predominatly consist of white, young & male frequent internet user. Although adherence to these beliefs varies, these are some common themes within the Alt-Right:

--

+ Antipathy towards both liberals (*“social justice warriors”*) and conservatives (*“cuckservatives”*) 

--

+ Fighting a *"culture war"* against perceived liberal consensus within the establishment

--

+ Belief that freedom of speech is being threatened by *"political correctness"*

--

+ Strong animosity towards feminism, multiculturalism and immigration (*"cultural marxism"*)

--

+ Belief in biological differences inbetween races and genders that justifies seperate treatment

--

+ Ambigious and troll-like behaviour as to ensure *plausible deniability*


---


## Groups of the Alt-Right I

The Alt-Right consists of...

--

> an amalgam of conspiracy theorists, techno-libertarians, white nationalists, Men’s Rights advocates, trolls, anti-feminists, anti-immigration activists, and bored young people [...]. [S]ome participants in this ecosystem are organized by their beliefs (like *"Men’s Rights Activists"*), while others are organized by particular media or platforms (such as individual blogs and podcasts). Thus, the lines between these groups are always blurry and uneven (Marwick and Lewis 2017).

## Alt-Right or Alt-Light

Some scholars have made the distinction between Alt-Right and Alt-Light:

> Media outlets that espouse some far-right talking points while strategically excluding more extreme beliefs such as scientific racism or anti-Semitism. Example: Breitbart News.

## Data Collection


---

## Where to find the Alt-Right?

--

* Online Discussion Boards e.g. Reddit, 4chan, Discord.
* Facebook, Twitter and YouTube 

For this research we were focused on social media. We collected millions of comment that were left under various Alt-Right network hubs on these platforms for the entirety of the year 2017. In addition, we also accessed the commentaries under popular (American) news outlets over the same timerange.

## Coding Framework

## Sampling & Data Preperation

As a first step we sampled 30.000 comments from the Alt-Right sample. We tried to make sure that each YouTube Video, Facebook or Twitter profile is equally represented in this subsample.

Next, we did some other things to the data?

Goal:

> Identify Alt-Right commentary on social media and its spread into mainstream media

This could include the spread of hoaxes and fake news or Alt-Right reaction to terrorist attacks.

This will be done with a machine learning process that necessitates a training and a test dataset.

In order to account for the multidimensionality of the Alt-Right sphere, we decided to use an extensive coding scheme that we will present with the app.

In total we labeled `r nrow(dt)` comments and tweets with the help of `r length(unique(dt$coder))` individual coders.

## Policy Implications

* Counter Narratives
* Taking complaints about ambiguity of hate speech seriously?
* Account for the *multidimensionality* of extremism
    + extremism is not only limited to hate speech, it's also ideological
* AI deletion: What about uncertainty and ambiguity of language.
* Human in the loop. 
* Feeback loop: get personal feedback. Restcricted times.
* Algorithemn must be repsonsive and transparent on how decisions are made. Highlight problematic content and a reason why. 
* Cross Checking Algorithemns improve the comprehension of how the system works and we get a chance to critize its blindspots. 
* More accountable AI programming.
