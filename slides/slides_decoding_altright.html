## What is the Alt-Right?

&lt;!-- + Term coined by Richard Spencer --&gt;

&lt;!-- + Goals --&gt;
&lt;!--     * allowed ideas long seen as unacceptable to mainstream media to seep into public discourse (opening the Overton window) --&gt;
&lt;!--     * By re-branding “white nationalism” or “white supremacy” as “the alt-right,” these groups played on the media’s fascination with novelty to give their ideas mass exposure --&gt;
&lt;!--     * As Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin puts it, “Non-ironic Nazism masquerading as ironic Nazism.” --&gt;

&lt;!-- Why use it? The Nazis called themselves national socialists and we shouldn't call them socialists but they were a distinct phenomenon. They're also more diverse as we shall see --&gt;

**Milo Yiannopolous' characterization of the Alt-Right:** `\(^1\)`

&gt; *The alt-right is a movement born out of the youthful, subversive, **underground edges of the internet**. 4chan and 8chan are hubs of alt-right activity. For years, members of these forums – political and non-political – have delighted in **attention-grabbing, juvenile pranks**. Long before the alt-right, 4channers turned **trolling** the national media into an in-house sport.*

**Marwick and Lewis 2017**

&gt; *Term coined by Richard Spencer to describe a version of **white nationalism** that positions itself as comprised of **younger, wealthier, and better-educated individuals** than traditional white supremacist groups like the Klu Klux Klan. Deeply entwined with social media and staples of **internet culture, like memes**. Believes that **“political correctness” threatens individual liberty**. Example: Jared Taylor of the American Renaissance, Mike Cernovich of Danger and Play.*

**Hawley 2017**

&gt; *Using the loosest definition, we could say the Alt-Right includes anyone with right-wing sensibilities that **rejects the mainstream conservative movement**. But there are certain common, perhaps universal attitudes within the Alt-Right. The Alt-Right is **fundamentally concerned with race**. At its core, the Alt-Right is a white-nationalist movement, even if many (perhaps most) of the people who identify with the Alt-Right do not care for that term. The most energetic and significant figures of the movement want to see the creation of a **white ethnostate** in North America.*

## What is the Alt-Right?


A group of loosely aligned individuals and subgroups that predominatly consist of white, young &amp; male frequent internet user. Although adherence to these beliefs varies, these are some common themes within the Alt-Right:

--

+ Antipathy towards both liberals (*“social justice warriors”*) and conservatives (*“cuckservatives”*) 

--

+ Fighting a *"culture war"* against perceived liberal consensus within the establishment

--

+ Belief that freedom of speech is being threatened by *"political correctness"*

--

+ Strong animosity towards feminism, multiculturalism and immigration (*"cultural marxism"*)

--

+ Belief in biological differences inbetween races and genders that justifies seperate treatment

--

+ Ambigious and troll-like behaviour as to ensure *plausible deniability*


---


## Groups of the Alt-Right I

The Alt-Right consists of...

--

&gt; an amalgam of conspiracy theorists, techno-libertarians, white nationalists, Men’s Rights advocates, trolls, anti-feminists, anti-immigration activists, and bored young people [...]. [S]ome participants in this ecosystem are organized by their beliefs (like *"Men’s Rights Activists"*), while others are organized by particular media or platforms (such as individual blogs and podcasts). Thus, the lines between these groups are always blurry and uneven (Marwick and Lewis 2017).

&lt;!-- ## Groups of the Alt-Right III --&gt;

&lt;!-- * Open White Supremacists (Richard Spencer, National Policy Institute, KKK) --&gt;
&lt;!-- * Neo Nazi Movements (Daily Stormer, Fash the Nation) --&gt;
&lt;!-- * YouTube Skeptic Community --&gt;
&lt;!-- * Online Discussion Boards (Sections like /pol on 4chan or /r the_Donald on reddit) --&gt;
&lt;!-- * Antifeminist YouTube (Sargon of Akkad) --&gt;
&lt;!-- * "Menosphere" (Roosh V, Return of Kings) --&gt;

&lt;!-- Sometimes very incompatible movements. --&gt;

&lt;!-- ## Alt-Right or Alt-Light --&gt;

&lt;!-- Some scholars have made the distinction between Alt-Right and Alt-Light: --&gt;

&lt;!-- &gt; Media outlets that espouse some far-right talking points while strategically excluding more extreme beliefs such as scientific racism or anti-Semitism. Example: Breitbart News. --&gt;

## Data Collection


---

## What data did collect?

--

+ Text data from three Platforms: Facebook, Twitter and YouTube 

&lt;img src="images/socialmedia.png"&gt;

--

+ Comments from 76 Alt-Right connected profiles/YouTube channels 

--

+ Comments from 7 Media Outles (CNN, MSNBC, ABC, Fox News, Washington Post, New York Times)

&lt;img src="images/media.png"&gt;

--

+ Comments from the entire year 2017

--

+ In total over 30 million comments/tweets

## Coding Framework

---

## Training Sample

*Our Approach:*

--

+ Supervised machine learning necessitates a training dataset of labeled comments that the algorithm can learn from

--

+ A balanced subsample of each YouTube Video, Facebook or Twitter profile from the Alt-Right corpus 

--

+ Setting up an extensive coding scheme that accounts for the multidimensionality of the Alt-Right sphere (indicators for racism, anti-semitism etc.)

--

+ Development of a *Shiny App* that allowed us to outsource the labeling task to 13 voluntary coders.

--

+  Krippendorf's	&amp;alpha; shows intercoder reliablity of around .5 (increases after burn-in phase)

--

+  In total we labeled 7580 comments and tweets.

## Case Study: Unite the Right Charlottesville Rally


.pull-left[


* Unite the Right Rallye in Charlottesville



&lt;td style="padding-top: 1.5px;"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

* Protests officially against removing a Statue of Robet E. Lee



&lt;td style="padding-top: 1.5px;"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

* Many Alt-Right Figures were present (Richard Spencer, Matthew Heimbach etc.)



&lt;td style="padding-top: 1.5px;"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

* 11th and 12th August of 2017



&lt;td style="padding-top: 1.5px;"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

* Lead to a deliberate attack and death of a counter-protester Heather Heyer

## Case Study: Unite the Right Charlottesville Rally

Possible other applications:

* How does the Alt-Right react after terror attacks
* Tracking stories and misinformation (like the hoax that two Syrian refugees were responsible for the Quebec Mosque Attack)
* Distinguishing between Alt-Light and Alt-Right content

## Policy Implications

## Policy Implications

* Account for the *multidimensionality* of extremism
    + extremism is not only limited to hate speech, it's also ideological
* More accountable AI programming:
    * AI deletion: What about uncertainty and ambiguity of language.
    * Human in the loop. 
    * Feedback loop: get personal feedback. Restcricted times.
    * Algorithm must be repsonsive and transparent on how decisions are made. 
    + Highlight problematic content and a reason why. 
    * Cross-checking algorithms improve the comprehension of how the system works and we get a chance to critize its blindspots

* Counter Narratives

* Taking complaints about ambiguity of hate speech seriously
